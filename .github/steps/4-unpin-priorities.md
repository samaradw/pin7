## ðŸ§¹ Step 4: Unpin to update priorities

Sometimes priorities change â€” that's where unpinning comes in.

In this step, you'll **unpin a Discussion** to reflect updated priorities or remove outdated announcements.

### ðŸ“Œ Why this matters
Unpinning Discussions helps keep your repository organized and focused. It ensures only the most relevant topics remain visible to your community.

### âœ… What to do
1. Go to the **Discussions** tab.
2. Look for a Discussion that has already been pinned (you'll see a ðŸ“Œ icon).
3. Scroll to the **bottom of the pinned Discussion**.
4. Click **"Unpin this Discussion"**.

Once unpinned, youâ€™ll automatically move on to the final step.
