## Step 4: Unpin to Update Priorities

Your projectâ€™s priorities can shift, and so can whatâ€™s most important for your team to see first.

Sometimes, a pinned discussion has served its purpose and should be unpinned to make space for more relevant or urgent content. This helps ensure your community or team always sees the most critical information at the top.

### ðŸ§­ Why this matters

Pinned discussions highlight key threads, but too many pinned discussions can cause clutter. Unpinning allows you to maintain a clean and relevant discussion board.

2. Click the **three dots (`â‹¯`)** in the upper right of the discussion box.
