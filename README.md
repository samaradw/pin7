## Step 3: Mark as Answer

✅ Let's help your community find clarity!

When you mark a reply as the answer to a discussion, it signals to everyone that the question has been resolved. This is particularly helpful in Q&A-style discussions where clarity and resolution are essential.

---

### 💡 Why this matters

Marking answers helps improve knowledge sharing. It makes it easier for other contributors to quickly identify which replies contain accurate or helpful solutions, reducing confusion and repeated questions.

---

### 💬 Activity: Mark a Reply as the Answer

1. Go to the discussion you created earlier.
2. Reply to it using another account or use an alternate reply on your post.
3. Hover over the reply that best answers your discussion.
4. Click the **✔️ Mark as answer** button to highlight it.

Once completed, GitHub Actions will detect this and move you to the next step!
