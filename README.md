Start this step by pinning your discussion so your community can quickly see the most important threads.

## Step 2: Pin a Discussion 📌

Now that you've started a discussion, let’s make sure it gets the visibility it deserves.

### 🤔 Why this matters

Pinned discussions stay at the top of your list and help everyone find key questions, announcements, or updates quickly. Use pinning to highlight critical info for your team or contributors.

### ⚙️ Activity: Pin Your Discussion

1. Go to your [Discussions tab](../../discussions).
2. Click into the discussion you just created.
3. In the top right panel, look for the **“Pin discussion to…”** option.
4. Click it. If successful, your discussion will now show a 📌 **Pinned** label.

Once pinned, wait about 20 seconds and refresh this page to unlock the next step!
